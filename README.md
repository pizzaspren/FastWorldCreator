Generate Minecraft worlds with your favourite datapacks in a couple clicks!

Tired of copying and pasting your datapacks every time you create a new world? Want to create a multitude of worlds in a very short time? Would you like to create worlds for different versions of Minecraft without even launching the game?

Look no further, this application is just what you need!

### Features
* Highly customizable world generation.
* Bundled with an optional loot randomizing datapack that works for ANY installed version.
* Drop your own datapacks in the `assets/datapacks` folder and they will become instantly available to all the new worlds you want to create.
* Select which datapacks you want to add to your world with a simple click.
* ...And much more!

*Functionality verified with 1.14.4 and 1.15.2, but should support full releases (not snapshots) from 1.13 onwards.*
